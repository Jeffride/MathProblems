From now on, each session at least having 2 parts: problems and videos from Khan Acadamy. Problems are for your practice; videos are for you understand the concept. Take notes if necessary. The notes could be on paper or in Word document (In this case, the two-monitor-setup will be useful). 

Pre-Algebra part is must-have. Algebra is nice-to-have. But honestly, I think Algebra part has more fun!

#### Problems
* Pre-Algebra   
    1. Explain why  ![exp]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/test/01.png)
    2. Compute  ![exp]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/test/02.png)

* Algebra
    1. Explain why  ![exp]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/test/03.png)
